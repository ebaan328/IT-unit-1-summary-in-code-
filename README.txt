I was originally thinking about sending my teacher this hole folder...
changed my mind.

Im gonna talk about this little project.

Teacher is giving out bonus points for a unit review; which was supposed to be a txt file.

But I was bored, and thought it might be a flex to code this hole thing for 5 points... So I did.

Its a pretty simple console app, that I havent test, but I hope works.

I Used what I could remember from C# (which are the basics); variables, methods, and arrays.

thats it.

methods and variables containing definitions, and one array resuming it all.

so a couple hours later, and some debugging and fixing.

I was able to run the script in vs...
and it worked.

Really proud.

It was a great time.
I basically did the hole thing while watching Brian play genshin impact.

great experience;
  good time.
